Documentation Matlab codes for Chapter 2.

two_point.m: Matlab function for solving 1D two-point BVP u''=f(x) with Dirichlet BC at x=a and x=b.
It is called by the driver Matlab script file main.m to generate Figure 2.1 (a)-(b). 
Files involved: two_point.m, f.m, main.m. 

compare.m: Generate Figure 2.3, also show the effect of round-off errors.

bw_at_b.m: Matlab function for solving 1D two-point BVP u''=f(x) with Dirichlet BC at x=a and a
Neumann BC at x=b using 1-st order backward FD.

ghost_at_b.m: Matlab function for solving 1D two-point BVP u''=f(x) with Dirichlet BC at x=a and a
Neumann BC at x=b using the ghost point method. 

ghost_and_bw.m: Matlab script file oo generate Figiure 2.4. It calls bw_at_b.m and ghost_at_b.m. Matlab 
function f.m is used.
