Documentation Matlab codes for Chapter 3.

In the director Poisson_Matlab:

poisson_matlab.m: Matlab code for solving Poisson equations on a rectangular domain by
forming the coefficient matrxi. The derivative BC is given at x=a, and Dirichlet BC is
given along other sides.

poisson_matlab_BigF.m: Plot with bigger fond.

Matfunction used: ue.m, the true solution; ux.m: derivative BC is given at x=a.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Poisson_SOR: Iterative schemes for solving Poisson equations on a rectangular domain.

poisson_jacobi.m: Jacobi method
poisson_sor.m: SOR(w) method, when w=1, it is the Gauss-Seidel method.

uexact.m: Matlab function of the true solution.
fcn.m: Matlab function of the source term f(x,y).
