# Jupyter_Notebooks
Some jupyter notebook codes from my coursework. Most of the programs are written in Python3 and some in Julia.

Some Python programs contain plots using plotly, which may not be visible on Github.To view these notebooks, go to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/, and type the url of the jupyter notebook from my github repository.
